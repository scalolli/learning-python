### Learning Python

I have been meaning to learn python for the longest time! I decided it was time as I need to learn Python
to read a repository which has been written in Python at work. 

Will be using this repository to track my progress as I go about
reading the book [Python Crash Course](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781098156664)
